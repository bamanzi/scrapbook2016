			<p>I’ll show you a snapshot of <a href="https://github.com/warmans/colour" target="_blank">colour</a>, and you can decide if you’re willing to build upon it.</p>
<p><a href="2014-07-31-lv-c5551-colour.jpg"><img src="2014-07-31-lv-c5551-colour_001.jpg" alt="2014-07-31-lv-c5551-colour" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6475" height="101" width="150"></a></p>
<p>colour is remarkably similar to <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/colorwrapper-quite-obviously-the-author-had-me-in-mind/" title="colorwrapper: Quite obviously, the author had me in mind" target="_blank">colorwrapper</a>, but will probably require a little more effort to bring up to the same level of flexibility. Both programs use profiles to filter program output and insert color.</p>
<p>But while colorwrapper (and <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/rainbow-color-filtering-in-a-different-way/" title="rainbow: Color filtering in a different way" target="_blank">rainbow</a> for that matter) seems to have a few more profiles available to it, colour has only two that I see — and both of them are intended for <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/NodeTool" target="_blank">nodetool</a>, which I think is somehow related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra" target="_blank">Apache Cassandra</a>. That’s waaay beyond my scope.</p>
<p>But colour comes with a couple of example files by default, so what you see in the screenshot is just those examples pumped through their respective profiles. I’m afraid I can’t show much more than that.</p>
<p>And since colour doesn’t seem to have any other configurations, I’m out of ways to use it. I know I should probably start making my own, but I’m short on time and only halfway interested in building up a collection of configurations for colour.</p>
<p>And probably you’ll be in the same boat. If you find colour promising, you’ll likely spend some time drafting your own configurations, for the programs you like and use.</p>
<p>It’s your decision — colorwrapper or rainbow, the more complete utilities … or colour, the underdog with potential.😉</p>

			</h1>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I just mentioned colordiff, but left out one thing it can do: colorize the output of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/" target="_blank">wdiff</a>. And what is wdiff, you say?</p>
<p><a href="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-wdiff-colordiff.png"><img src="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-wdiff-colordiff_001.png" alt="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-wdiff-colordiff" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6379" height="112" width="150"></a></p>
<p>That should give you an idea. wdiff works in the same way as <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/diff-tools-to-show-you-whats-changed/" title="diff: Tools to show you what’s changed" target="_blank">diff</a>, but at a word-by-word level. If you look closely in the upper half of that image, the differences in lines of text are offset with brackets and curly braces.</p>
<p>That may be enough for you, but you have to admit that the second half, where the output was piped through colordiff, is much easier to scan. The man page says you should add <code>-n</code> to wdiff before sending it through colordiff, but as you can see there, it worked fine in that example. </p>
<p>wdiff works well with colordiff, but you might prefer <a href="https://code.google.com/p/cj-overlay/" target="_blank">cwdiff</a>, as opposed to piping things through one another.</p>
<p><a href="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-cwdiff.png"><img src="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-cwdiff_001.png" alt="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-cwdiff" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6381" height="112" width="150"></a></p>
<p>cwdiff does much of what wdiff + colordiff offers, and simplifies the process quite a bit. There are a few added options too, including one to subtract the color from the output — meaning you get pretty much what wdiff had originally.</p>
<p>By default, cwdiff’s output is simplified somewhat from what wdiff creates, or what wdiff produces through colordiff. It’s not necessarily better, but it is a tiny bit … different.🙄</p>
<p><a href="http://os.ghalkes.nl/dwdiff.html" target="_blank">dwdiff</a> is the last on the list that I feel obligated to mention at this point. By now, you’ll probably feel like dwdiff doesn’t really do anything that wdiff, colordiff, cwdiff or even just diff could handle. </p>
<p><a href="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-dwdiff.png"><img src="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-dwdiff_001.png" alt="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-dwdiff" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6382" height="112" width="150"></a></p>
<p>dwdiff also plucks out differences between words of files, and has a <code>-c</code> flag to inject color into the output. The distinguishing point between dwdiff and the others, as I see it, is its ability to set specific delimiters while searching. </p>
<p>I couldn’t think of a good case example for that, and I searched around in hopes of finding something to test it. Nothing handy appeared though, and most examples for dwdiff seemed to generate the same output as wdiff alone or cwdiff might get you.</p>
<p>So the final questions become academic: First, do you want colorized output (say yes! say yes!); and second, do you need control over specific delimiters when comparing files?</p>
<p>If you answer yes to the first, cwdiff might be the best tool, although you can get the same results from wdiff alone if you have colordiff available. If you answer yes to the second, you’ll most likely want dwdiff regardless of your preference for color.</p>
<p>And if neither of those questions is important … well, then you can probably get through the day with just the original diff tool. No shame in that.😉</p>

			<p>Remember my unnatural predilection for anything in color? You have to admit I’m right on this point. After all, which would you rather look at?</p>
<p><a href="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-colordiff.png"><img src="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-colordiff_001.png" alt="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-colordiff" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6373" height="112" width="150"></a></p>
<p>At the top, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/diff-tools-to-show-you-whats-changed/" title="diff: Tools to show you what’s changed" target="_blank">diff</a>. At the bottom, <a href="http://www.colordiff.org/" target="_blank">colordiff</a>. The choice should be an easy one.</p>
<p>The man page describes colordiff as a perl wrapper for diff, and that’s very true. As a matter of fact, it’s so tightly wound around diff that if you ask for <code>colordiff --help</code>, you get the output from <code>diff --help</code>.😕 And I know there’s no difference because I used colordiff to show the difference between <code>diff --help</code> and <code>colordiff --help</code>, and there was no difference. See what I mean?❓</p>
<p><a href="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-colordiff-diff-diff.jpg"><img src="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-colordiff-diff-diff_001.jpg" alt="2014-07-27-lv-c5551-colordiff-diff-diff" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6375" height="98" width="150"></a></p>
<p>Clear as mud.</p>
<p>colordiff has its own rc file, installed by default at /etc/colordiff in the Arch version. I would advise you to copy that into .colordiffrc, and customize the colors there, but if you’re just one of those weirdos who runs a black-on-white terminal emulator, you’d do just as well to copy /etc/colordiff-lightbg into your .colordiffrc file instead.</p>
<p>That’s about all I can think about with colordiff. It stays very tight to the original tool while still giving you a small measure of customization, and that will probably keep you happy in your pursuit of differences.😉</p>

<p>I get razzed occasionally about my preference for color in … well, in just about anything that passes through the console. I must not be the only one, for <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/colorize/" target="_blank">as many colorize tools</a> as there are.</p>
<p><a href="http://cwrapper.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">colorwrapper</a> — instead of screening program output for colorizable (is that a word?) strings, or requiring you to select a color scheme from a list — uses an executable preset profile to catch and colorize the results of a command. (I’m avoiding the word “wrapper” here, just for clarity.)</p>
<p>I don’t know how to explain that properly. But here’s a snippet from the profile that produced the colorized version of <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/pstree-simple-yet-effective/" title="pstree: Simple yet effective" target="_blank">pstree</a>, above.</p>
<pre>#!/home/kmandla/.cw/bin/cw
path /bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:
ifnarg -G:-U
base cyan
digit green+:default
match white:default |
...
match white:default )
match white:default init</pre>
<p>I trimmed away a little bit for the sake of space. But I think you get the idea — the profile tells colorwrapper what to pluck out, and where the colors appear.</p>
<p>By default, colorwrapper comes with a huge list of profiles for commonplace Unix-y commands, and if you take a little time you should be able to either edit those to your particular color scheme, or to produce some of your own. For what I’ve seen of colorwrapper, the markdown is fairly intuitive.</p>
<p>This is something we’ve seen before, in programs like <a title="rainbow: Color filtering in a different way" href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/rainbow-color-filtering-in-a-different-way/" target="_blank">rainbow</a>. Compare what <a href="2014-03-26-lv-r1fz6-rainbow-ping.png" target="_blank">rainbow does</a> with <a title="ping: Everybody wants to be the ping" href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/ping-everybody-wants-to-be-the-ping/" target="_blank">ping</a>, to what colorwrapper does:</p>
<p><a href="2014-07-17-6m47421-colorwrapper-ping.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6219" src="2014-07-17-6m47421-colorwrapper-ping_001.jpg" alt="2014-07-17-6m47421-colorwrapper-ping" height="115" width="150"></a></p>
<p>Not everything is green and cyan with colorwrapper, by the way. It depends on the tool and the profile.😉</p>
<p>A few caveats, because there always are some: colorwrapper is pushing toward five years without an apparent update; I mention that out of a sense of obligation and because I know there are some folks who won’t touch a program older than a few weeks, regardless of how well it works. Whatever.❓</p>
<p>That does suggest though that some profiles (I didn’t check them all) might not be current with what the tool can do. The author talks about colorizing top, for example, and as we all know, <a title="top: The cool tool you didn’t know you had" href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/02/23/top-the-cool-tool-you-didnt-know-you-had/" target="_blank">top has its own built-in color scheme system</a>. We all know that, right? RIGHT?!👿</p>
<p>Second, I am sure you noticed that there was a slight difference between the output of straight pstree and colorwrapper’s version of pstree. You might want to step through the profiles you like best, to make sure the output you prefer is what appears with colorwrapper.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to give colorwrapper a test run before committing, notice that the <code>make</code> command has an option for <code>localinstall</code> which will drop everything into $HOME/.cw … which makes it easier to get rid of, when you realize K.Mandla is stark raving mad.🙄</p>
<p>I’ll leave the rest for you to discover. The home page for colorwrapper is particularly sparse, but the bundled documentation is quite good. Watch for headers and footers too, which throw an added color element into the equation. Have fun!<img class="wp-smiley emoji" draggable="false" alt=":)" src="simple-smile.svg" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" height="16" width="16"></p>

			<p>I’ve seen quite a few text colorizers in the past year or so, the most recent being <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/pygments-because-everyone-loves-color/" title="pygments: Because everyone loves color" target="_blank">pygments</a>, but even as far back as <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/highlighter-picking-out-letters-words-phrases/" title="highlighter: Picking out letters, words, phrases" target="_blank">highlighter</a> or <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/09/27/colout-colorize-on-a-whim/" title="colout: Colorize on a whim" target="_blank">colout</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nicoulaj/rainbow" target="_blank">rainbow</a> seems to work a little differently from those. </p>
<p><a href="2014-03-26-lv-r1fz6-rainbow-ping.png"><img src="2014-03-26-lv-r1fz6-rainbow-ping_001.png" alt="2014-03-26-lv-r1fz6-rainbow-ping" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4666" height="112" width="150"></a></p>
<p>rainbow has quite a few presets to correspond to common commands and applications. As you can see, you can tack on the command to rainbow, and the results are “converted” from dull black and white to something a bit more … rainbow-y.😀</p>
<p>You can make your own configurations to match the applications you use most, and voila! Your boring old text app is now in vibrant living color.</p>
<p>This sounds like my kind of program.<img class="wp-smiley emoji" draggable="false" alt=":mrgreen:" src="mrgreen.svg" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" height="16" width="16"></p>
<p>Unfortunately (there had to be an “unfortunately” coming, didn’t there?), it seems some of the best effects are intended for terminal emulators. Some effects were lost or mangled at the framebuffer, and just didn’t line up quite right.</p>
<p>And there seems to be a slight discrepancy between what rainbow can accept as a command, and what it reads as flags for its own interpretation. In other words, sometimes flags for the target application were being seized by rainbow, which triggered errors. I’m still working on ways around that.</p>
<p>And while I appreciate the length and breadth of available sample configurations, I have to wonder if it’s really necessary to have some of them. </p>
<p><a href="2014-03-26-lv-r1fz6-rainbow-top.png"><img src="2014-03-26-lv-r1fz6-rainbow-top_001.png" alt="2014-03-26-lv-r1fz6-rainbow-top" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4667" height="112" width="150"></a></p>
<p>top, when injected into rainbow’s sample config, isn’t nearly as impressive as <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/02/23/top-the-cool-tool-you-didnt-know-you-had/" title="top: The cool tool you didn’t know you had" target="_blank">top on its own</a>.</p>
<p>So it’s a bit caveat emptor: For some things, it’s sheer genius. For others, not so much.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I intend to work out a configuration for <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/nethack-needs-no-introduction/" title="nethack: Needs no introduction" target="_blank">nethack</a>. The world needs a colorized version of nethack.🙄</p>

			<p>I have, on occasion, let slip the fact that terminal application that employ color win my favor more easily. I suppose I should keep that quiet, but it would be dishonest to do otherwise.</p>
<p>It might follow that applications that add color to things get an extra thumbs-up from me. Well, sometimes yes. <a href="http://pygments.org/" target="_blank">pygments</a> gets a thumbs-up either way.</p>
<p><a href="2014-03-21-lv-r1fz6-pygments.png"><img src="2014-03-21-lv-r1fz6-pygments_001.png" alt="2014-03-21-lv-r1fz6-pygments" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4600" height="112" width="150"></a></p>
<p>pygments is sort of twofold: Not only does it colorize text, like you see above, but it can also set up text to appear colorized in other formats. So you can output, for example, your text file re-encoded to appear colorized in html. As an illustration, this …</p>
<pre>pygmentize -f html coreutils.htm</pre>
<p>changes this … </p>

<p>That might be a little dense to look at, but take my word for it.🙄</p>
<p>(Of course, if that’s the direction you’re going, then perhaps the <a href="http://pygments.org/demo/" target="_blank">web interface</a> is easier to copy-and-paste.😉 )</p>
<p>I like pygments for doing a little more than <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/09/27/colout-colorize-on-a-whim/" title="colout: Colorize on a whim" target="_blank">colout</a> or <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/highlighter-picking-out-letters-words-phrases/" title="highlighter: Picking out letters, words, phrases" target="_blank">highlighter</a>, and having the extra option to “convert” the product to a different “format.” It’s not often that I need to colorize files but I intend to employ this when the time comes.😉</p>

			<p>I’m not sure where I heard about <a href="https://github.com/mattissf/highlighter" target="_blank">highlighter</a>, but I have a feeling it’s been on my list for a long time.</p>
<p><a href="2013-11-23-lv-r1fz6-highlighter.jpg"><img src="2013-11-23-lv-r1fz6-highlighter_001.jpg" alt="2013-11-23-lv-r1fz6-highlighter" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3195" height="112" width="150"></a></p>
<p>highlighter is a python program that behaves like a color filter. You could compare it with grep in some ways, but grep plucks out lines that match; highlighter just tweaks the color.</p>
<p>highlighter stays out of the way; if you just execute <code>hl</code> on its own, not much happens. You might have to pipe text through it.</p>
<p>That does make it convenient for some other applications though: Send the output of a program through highlighter to add some color to the original results.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this before, in <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/09/27/colout-colorize-on-a-whim/" title="colout: Colorize on a&nbsp;whim" target="_blank">colout</a> and <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/ccze-colorize-your-logs-as-an-added-step/" title="ccze: Colorize your logs, as an added&nbsp;step" target="_blank">ccze</a> (though that’s more for colorizing logs) and perhaps some others. One shortcoming that I found with highlighter is that it didn’t seem to work in a virtual console; all I got was text of the same color. I’m not sure why.😕</p>
<p>This is not in AUR or Debian that I could find; you might have to install this manually out of git or with pip. Enjoy.</p>
