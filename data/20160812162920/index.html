The important things to take into account when looking to buy a Linux powered laptops are as follows to avoid any hardware compatibility problems. Selecting correct specification is important. In this first part, I will cover what to look out for when buying a Linux powered laptop.<br> <span id="more-6895"></span></p><p></p><center>  <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: inline-block; width: 336px; height: 280px;" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7825705102693166" data-ad-slot="2404767461"></ins> <p></p></center><p></p><h2>Laptop Usage</h2><p>First, you need to decide and define the purpose of your laptop. Linux laptop can be used for simple office tasks and browsing the Internet or sending e-mails, than a mid-range laptop may be good enough:</p><ol><li>Define your budget</li><li>Define screen size notebook (13″ or 15″ or 17″)</li><li>Define your tasks such as Internet, sys admin, software development, some gaming using Win Vista / 7, dual booting etc.</li><li>How many hours of battery life do you need?</li><li>Define optical media types – Do you want to watch movies using DVD or Blu ray? Do you want to burn DVDs?</li><li>To play games you need a top spec laptop. Please note that Linux has limited support for popular PC gaming titles. So you need to dual boot your laptop with MS-Windows operating systems.</li><li>Finally, some people prefer desktop replacements with mobile workstations.</li></ol><p>In short, decide how you are going to be using the Linux laptop.</p><h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2><p>CPU is the brain of your laptop. Linux supports all sort of mobile cpus. Linux does supports SMP cpus on servers and it does support portables cpus too. The following are well know mobile cpus:</p><ul><li>Intel Atom</li><li>Intel Core 2 Duo</li><li>Intel Core i5 Duo</li><li>Intel Core i7 Duo or Quad</li><li>AMD Athlon 64 Mobile</li><li>AMD Turion 64 X2</li></ul><p>The speed range from 1.3GHz to 2.2GHz or more.  The number of cores plays an important role too. Naturally, a quad core CPU should be able to increase the number of calculations. This is useful when you run multiple applications, you will get fast and smooth response from the system. The <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/laptop/processors/index.htm" target="_blank">Intel Core 2 Duo</a> or <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ComputingSolutions/0,,30_288_13239_13253,00.html" target="_blank">AMD Turion 64</a> II (dual core) is pretty popular choice for CPU. My advice is go for 64 bit CPU with 64 bit Linux distro.</p><h2>Video Card and X Server</h2><p>This is the most important part in Laptop which is used by X Windows. However, selecting correct Video card is important; otherwise you will end up with 3D hardware accelerated card with 2D Linux driver or just basic display. So make sure your video card with 3D acceleration is supported under Linux. Nvidia has pretty good support with a proprietary driver which can deliver full 3D acceleration with 24 bit color. On other hand ATI drivers are open source. My advice is simple visit the following driver pages and make sure your video card is fully supported including 3D acceleration:</p><ul><li><a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank">ATI/AMD Linux drivers</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html" target="_blank">Nvidia Linux drivers</a></li><li><a href="http://intellinuxgraphics.org/" target="_blank">Linux Graphics drivers from Intel</a></li><li>Look <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/Projects/Drivers" target="_blank">here at X.org to check</a>, if your graphics card / chipset is supported or not.</li></ul><h3>Low End Video Cards</h3><p>The following list summaries low end fully supported Linux video cards:</p><ul><li>Intel GMA 4500MHD</li><li>Intel 945GM</li><li>Intel 950 GMA</li><li>Intel X3100 GMA</li><li>NVIDIA Quadro NVS 160M (256MB)</li></ul><h3>Mid to High-End Video Cards</h3><p>The following list summaries mid-high end priced fully supported Linux dedicated video cards (useful for playing 3D videogames or engineering Linux apps or video / photo editing):</p><ul><li>NVIDIA Quadro FX 880M (1024 MB)</li><li>NVIDIA Quadro FX 2800M (1024 MB)</li><li>NVIDIA Quadro NVS 3100M (256 or 512 MB)</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce 9300M GS</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce 9300M</li><li>Intel GMA X4500 HD</li><li>ATI FirePro M7740 (1024 MB)</li><li>ATI Radeon HD 3650 (512 MB)</li><li>ATI Mobility Radeon HD4650 (1024 MB)</li></ul><p>Finally, make sure external X display to your desktop monitor is fully supported. This can come handy when you want to watch movies, play games or do business presentation.</p><h2>RAM</h2><p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is another factor which can boost your speed easily, especially if you use RAM intensive apps like virtualization desktop software (e.g., <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/vmware-on-centos5-rhel5-64-bit-version.html">VMWare</a> or VirtualBox), photo editing (e.g., Gimp), <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/top5-linux-video-editing-system-software/">video editing</a> etc.  2 to 4 GB should be more than sufficient for most apps. A few high end laptops can support upto 16GB ram and Linux can <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-4gb-ram-limitation-solution/">access more than 4GB ram using PAE or 64bit</a> kernel out of the box.</p><h2>Hard Disk</h2><p>Hard disk is used to store all your data and boot into Linux. Hard disks are cheaper, nosier and stores data on moving parts called rotating platters. You can have 7200rpm drives. Another option is to use SSD ( Solid State Drives ) as storage device which offers the following benefits:</p><ol><li>Speed (2 times faster than hard disk)</li><li>Lighter and quieter (no moving parts)</li><li>Consume less power</li><li>Faster booting time.</li></ol><p>You can add additional storage using USB or Firewire ports (i.e. external hard disk).   My advice is go for SSD.</p><h2>Optical Disk</h2><p>Linux does support DVDs, Blu ray and other optical formats. This is useful for playing DVDs or backing up data via DVD/CD burner. DVD burner is fine for most applications. But, if you are interested in playing movies using Blu ray (HD DVD / Blu Ray disks), you will need to get Blue ray optical drive which can <em>read and write DVDs too</em>. However, the AACS ‘Digital Rights Management’ system in most HD-DVD and all Blu-Ray discs attempts to stop consumers from exercising fair use rights, including – playing purchased Blu-Ray and HD DVD films using Open Source software. To play Blu ray you need the latest <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/" target="_blank">version of mplayer</a> and <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=123111" target="_blank">DumpHD</a> to perform the decryption necessary to play the film. If you can afford go for Blu ray. See how to play <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/BluRayAndHDDVD">Blu-Ray and HD DVD video</a> under Ubuntu Linux.</p><h2>Power Management: Suspend and Hibernate</h2><p>Linux supports both AMP ( Advanced Power Management ) and ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ) which allows you to hibernate the system to a disk partition using swsusp (Software Suspend). It is a suspend-to-disk implementation in the 2.6 series Linux kernel. However, some laptop may give you <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-suspend-hibernate-functionality-support/">problem with swsusp</a>. You may also need to compile  kernel to include swsusp support. Make sure you get ACPI compliant BIOS and you should be fine with power management. Some time you may need to download a patch from 3rd party or vendor site to enable suspend and hibernate support under Linux.</p><h2>Wireless 802.11</h2><p>Another hardware device may not work at all; if you do not pay attention to wireless devices. Most laptops comes with on-board 802.11 (a/b/g/N) wireless cards. Not all card supported so make sure you get Intel Pro series card such as 3945 or Atheros based cards. My advice is use Google to search for your driver or use specialized <a href="http://linux-wless.passys.nl/" target="_blank">databases</a> (a more or less complete listing of wireless devices with information about the chipset they are based on and whether or not they are supported in Linux) to search for your laptop card.</p><h2>Biometric Fingerprint Scanner</h2><p>Fingerprint scanners are security systems of biometrics. If you work for Government, DoD, police, security industries and, if data security and authentication is your top priority, you need “Biometric Fingerprint Scanner”. Every fingerprint is special and different from each other. You can use Linux PAM to hook fingerprint reader with KDM, GDM, sudo, su and many other services. The fingerprint scanners on the following models are known to work:</p><ul><li>IBM ThinkPad T and X series selected models (see <a href="http://www.reactivated.net/fprint/wiki/Supported_devices" target="_blank">list of supported</a> devices)</li><li>Dell Latitude selected models</li><li>HP Pavilion (selected model)</li></ul><p>Please refer the following additional pages and make sure your laptop model is supported:</p><ul><li><a href="http://reactivated.net/fprint/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">The fprint project</a> aims to plug a gap in the Linux desktop: support for consumer fingerprint reader devices.</li><li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/Fingerprint" target="_blank">Fedora project</a> wiki page describing supported devices and software for fingerprint devices.</li></ul><h2>Fn key (BlueKey) Support</h2><p>Fn, or Function, is a modifier key on many keyboards, especially on laptops, used in a compact layout to combine keys which are usually kept separate. It is mainly used for the purpose of changing display or audio settings quickly, such as brightness, contrast, or volume, and is held down in conjunction with the appropriate key to change the settings. These features may be supported under Linux via driver or software. I found most laptop from reputed manufacture (such as Dell, IBM) does supports Fn keys.</p><h2>Ports</h2><p>The following are common ports for laptop:</p><ol><li><strong>USB</strong> – It is well supported under Linux for external hard disk, pen, mouse, keyboard and much more.</li><li><strong>FireWire</strong> – It may or may not work out of box. In most cases you need to compile the Linux kernel so that you can access Zip drives, hard drives, and CDRW/DVD drives. However, support is limited. See <a href="https://ieee1394.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">Linux kernel IEEE 1394/ FireWire drivers</a> wiki page for more information.</li><li><strong>eSATA</strong> -External SATA provides a variant of SATA meant for external connectivity. It allows you to connect external SATA hard drives directly to the SATA bus. You get faster speed as compare to USB or Firewire external hard disks. This may or may not work out of box.</li></ol><h2>Sound</h2><p>Most on board sound card should work fine with Linux. You can play all sort of music file such as .mp3, .wav, .ogg and much more. Linux comes with various playback and mp3 players. You can <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-ripping-and-encoding-audio-files/">rip audio cds</a> too.</p><h2>Docking Station (Port Replicator)</h2><p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_station" target="_blank">Docking station and port replicator</a> provides a simplified way of â€œplugging-inâ€ an electronic device such as a laptop computer via common peripherals. You can plug desktop monitor, keyboard, printer, mouse, Palm Pilot and so on. Most docking station should work out of the box. Just confirm this with your vendor.</p><h2>Ethernet (NIC)</h2><p>Most NICs are supported but it is a good idea to go through Google and make sure your Ethernet card is supported. Usually, Intel and Broadcom (tg3) Ethernet cards are well supported. See <a href="http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/" target="_blank">Linux PCI ids</a> database and search for your sound and Ethernet card names. Usually, most drivers are included in running kernel. In rare case you may have to compile the kernel or driver to support your Ethernet card.</p><h2>Tip: Test Your Laptop With Linux (Try Before You Buy)</h2><p>Most vendors have a showrooms and shops. Visit nearest shop with Linux Live CD (such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.knoppix.net/">Knoppix</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download">Ubuntu</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD">Fedora</a> ) and ask them to boot laptop using Live CD. See if it works or not; boot into Linux. Make sure you can see X Windows, connects to the Internet via wireless card and so on. If you get 100% result, then just purchase it.</p><h2>Recommend Linux Distribution</h2><p>Linux is all about choices. Personally, I use Redhat v5.x 64 bit at work and Ubuntu Linux 64 bit at home. My recommendation:</p><ol><li>Ubuntu (any flavor) Linux – For the average user, with a strong focus on usability  and ease of use and installation.</li><li>Fedora Linux – Another popular disro for the average user with rpm based packages. Fedora is also popular among Windows and UNIX sys admins.</li><li>OpenSuse Linux – Easy to use and certified on selected HP / IBM laptops.</li><li>Debian Linux – For the advanced users, sys admin and academic researchers.</li><li>Slackware Linux – One of the oldest distro, preferred by sys admins, BSD lovers and academic researchers.</li></ol><h2>Linux Laptop Vendors</h2><p>Now, you know how to choose a laptop, especially you need to pay attention to wireless, video card and Ethernet card. And here is exact model names &amp; number that will be fully compatible to LINUX and vendor website (the list is for information and ready references only; please <strong>do your own research before purchasing system</strong>):</p><ol><li><a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/ubuntu?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;cs=19" target="_blank">Dell sales Ubuntu Laptop</a> in<strong> USA, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain and Latin America</strong>.

Proprietary drivers  are the the Achillesâ€™ heel of GNU/Linux and if you are going to buy a Linux laptop then you shouldn’t have to put up with it. With proprietary drivers and firmware you can’t be sure about future support and in many cases can make your system highly unstable (NDISWrapper).</p><p>Debian, Trisquel, ALASA, and other projects are working hard to remove such drivers/firmware or have never accepted such drivers/firmware.</p><p>I have a list of a few companies to warn about which purport to be free software supporters and fail to live up to the ideals and one that actually does:</p><p>laclinux.com/gnu – Even the free software foundation has recommended them, but sadly they don’t ship systems that are compatible with free software. They only appear to be contributing financially. This company sells Lenovo systems and such systems are problematic with many distributions. Lenovo, HP, and Toshiba include digital restrictions management software right in the BIOS! This prevents you from replacing the Mini PCIe card and installing a free software compatible wifi card.</p><p><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuPre-installed" rel="nofollow">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuPre-installed</a></p><p>Here we have a list of companies which whom some are purporting to support free software and GNU/Linux.  One is and one isn’t.</p><p><a href="http://www.inatux.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.inatux.com/</a> is listed as only selling free software compatible systems. This is not accurate. They ship systems with NVidia graphics and NVidia does not support free software in any manor that is sufficient. The same is true of VIA. ATI and Intel are the only two graphics chipset manufacturers which are actively supporting free software and doing a good job. The other issue I have here is they are selling a Toshiba laptop. Toshiba has the same problem Lenovo and HP have. They restrict the wifi cards that can be installed. This limits the support in GNU/Linux. The other issue is you are being forced to contribute to a company that is actively stifling free software through licensing agreements from the company which they get there laptops from (Microsoft/Toshiba).</p><p>As bad as the others are there is some light at the end of the tunnel. <a href="http://www.thinkpenguin.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkpenguin.com/</a> appears to be doing a really good job of supporting free software. They clearly list the chipsets and I can verify those chipsets do have excellent support for free software. There is also no Microsoft Tax or other digital restrictions built-in. They also explicitly support Trisquel. Something nobody else appears to be doing. If that didn’t beat all they have Trisquel and powered by GNU/Linux case badges!</p><p>The only thing I will frown on is they don’t ship with a free BIOS. That isn’t generally a problem for users or a fair criticism really. It wouldn’t be feasible without a significant investment from a major market player to put out such a notebook. There would be a number of limitations too. It would not be X86 based. There is only one system which has ever sold which has been completely free (supposedly). It was a netbook from a chinese manufacturer. It did not run X86 software, was very slow, and for all intensive purposes not something any normal human being could survive on. Richard Stallman owns one and is the only person I know who somehow manages to survive :). He is not a normal human being. A god maybe. But human? No way.</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-176608" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="comment-156120"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author"><a href="http://offmygourd.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow" class="url">Kevin Bush</a></span> <span class="comment_date">May 21, 2010, 2:55 pm</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-156120"><p>Hi,<br> Looks like you left out Zareason from your linux laptops list.

The addressing is slightly slower, but 32-bit applications are smaller.</p><p>@Vivik, you can test this yourself by installed 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the same distro on the same machine. The 64-bit version uses a bit more memory. IIRC, it’s something between 10..50% more for typical desktop applications. If your CPU has a small L2 cache, the x86-64 might actually be slower. E.g. intel e2160 runs faster in 32-bit x86 mode.</p><p>64-bit instructions aren’t radically faster. The biggest advantages of 64-bit distros are a) possibly better static instruction scheduling because of different compiler options b) availability of SSE2+ instructions vs i586 or i686 optimized binaries c) twice as much registers available d) wider registers.</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-160618" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment even depth-4" id="comment-160673"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author">Anders</span> <span class="comment_date">November 3, 2010, 12:18 am</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-160673"><p>Of course, you should always test if you can.

And THAT make a large difference in speed. I have written some small compilers, and more registers are merrier.  The previous x86 CPU:s had problems with a shortage of registers.  Wider is a bonus, but usually only for special programs.

They don’t use non-free drivers or firmware. Want to run GNewSense? Guess what. You can (at least if you update kernel, audio drivers, etc. distro is a little outdated)! Want 3D acceleration to work without sucking your battery life? It won’t. Want to want HD content? You can. There are a million and one reasons not to go with the other vendors. At one time I bought from LinuxCertified, EmperorLinux, and others because they were the only guys in the business. Not any more though. And Dell? Well… lets not go there. They don’t even put out working systems let along working GNU/Linux systems. Then again half the GNU/Linux vendors don’t either. I even got a LinuxCertified system with MS Windows sticker on it and I thought I wasn’t pay the Microsoft tax. So much for that. At least EmperorLinux didn’t tell me I wasn’t paying for it. If you’re going to un-bundle it fine-but LinuxCertified didn’t as I could still install MS Windows with the same key.</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-159328" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment even depth-2" id="comment-159329"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author"><a href="http://libreblog.wordpress.org/" rel="external nofollow" class="url">joe</a></span> <span class="comment_date">September 5, 2010, 3:15 am</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-159329"><p>Ohh I almost forgot.

I am an IT professional and have tried Linux on dozens of desktops and laptops. So far I have NEVER found a wireless card that works – I have been trying Linux on and off since 1996, through red hat, suse, mandrake/mandriva, fedora, and now ubuntu. None of them worked with any of my wireless cards – or with any of the wireless cards of other computers I tried.<br> The same is true with many -mostly ATI graphic cards. At the moment I have two HP’s, two Dells, two Toshiba’s and a Gateway – none of them can install the wireless driver or the 3d proprietary graphics driver. I spent countless hours looking on forums on the internet, trying to find a solution that works – it seems that Broadcom chips, which are the most common wireless chip in wireless cards, simply do not work with Linux. The Broadcom driver ALWAYS crashes when you try to install it wither from System&gt;Administration&gt;Adittional drivers, or from the console. Same with the ATI drivers.</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-170389" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment even depth-2" id="comment-170454"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author">Anders</span> <span class="comment_date">April 3, 2011, 5:36 pm</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-170454"><p>As an IT professional, which have used Linux from around 96-97 and exclusivly Linux since 2003.<br> I have not had any problems with wireless cards on any of my many laptops I have installed Linux on the last 4 years.<br> Yes, there was lot of problems in the beginning, but as more manufaturers are aware of Linux, esp. in Android market, they now know that they have to have god drivers on Linux too, or they are out of Android market.

It used to be, because you only could use the BUGG MS Windows driver, but since some years now there is an Open Source that works out of the box for Broadcom.<br> I use Debian Testing on my desktops, which is newer than Ubuntu.

Most companies with ‘Linux’ laptops aren’t taking these factors into consideration and users pay the price for it from critical things not working to upgrading and switching problems.</p><p>AMD (currently, drivers are still a work in progress)<br> NVIDIA (they only have proprietary drivers available which creates power management issues)</p><p>You want to make sure it has Intel Graphics as the source code is available you get proper power management. The older ATI chipsets work too although you obviously can’t get them in a new laptop.</p><p>Look for Atheros 802.11N chipset. All the MiniPCI-E cards with this 802.11N chipset have free drivers available. None of the others will work across all distributions and versions (you still need to have a relatively recent versions of GNU/Linux for the chipsets on the market to work, Ubuntu 10.04 stable for instance would be sufficient).</p><p>Printers. HP is one of the few if not only companies really supporting free software. Other vendors release proprietary drivers where you may have problems out of the box or in the future getting the printer to work. Even HP isn’t perfect. They have a site that thoroughly documents which printers depend on a proprietary non-free license or partly depend on software under such a license.</p><p>You can search for a printer at<br> <a href="http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/supported_devices/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/supported_devices/index.html</a> and check if it lists the “driver plug-in” as required, optional, or none (not required).</p><p>Driver plug-in	None	See note 8.</p><p>USB Wifi Cards are a problem. Most companies don’t indicate which chipset is in use on the box and will frequently change chipsets while retaining the same model number. As a result the lists indicating which cards to buy for GNU/Linux are unreliable. Users will often find that a card that supposedly worked no longer retains a particular chipset and may not even work with any version or distribution of GNU/Linux. Right now the best free chipsets are from Atheros and Ralink for USB wifi cards. AR9170 (802.11N) and RTL8187B (802.11B). There are few places to really knowingly obtain a card with either chipset. The 802.11B is a little easier to find. Cards with both chipsets are available from ThinkPenguin.com.</p><p>There are currently no 802.11 / bluetooth combo MiniPCI cards for laptops compatible free distributions. A better alternative to this is getting a USB bluetooth adapter which hides in a USB slot.</p><p>If I recall correctly there are some MiniPCI GSM cards available too which work with free systems.</p><p>This is a pretty good summary for more popular hardware. There are others I didn’t mention. If you have something of a rarer ask at ThinkPenguin.com. Free distributions are supported so you can be sure you are getting a solid answer to any question about what hardware to get for ‘Linux’.</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-172203" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-172274"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author">paco sanchez</span> <span class="comment_date">July 4, 2011, 5:02 pm</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-172274"><p>I would add to your suggested list of distros Arch Linux for several reasons:</p><p>1. It takes a KISS method to everything.  This may seem like a flaw at first but you will quickly find it is highly advantageous.</p><p>2. Although it comes pretty barebones out of the box, the documentation is by far the best for any linux distro (especially the beginners guide).  This is especially important for laptops where you need to get odd hardware to work (WWAN cards, fingerprint readers, etc).</p><p>3. The community is also extremely helpful.  Most Arch users/experts are very willing to help and, unlike some other distros which shall remain nameless, Arch is not being used by hundreds of thousands of P0wn (what the hell does this mean anyway?) and n00b 14 year old idiots.</p><p>4. It is a “rolling release” which means that you can ALWAYS be up to date with just one simple command.  With other distros, you must do a full upgrade whenever they decide to release a new version.  At first I thought rolling release might cause instability in my systems but this has been far from the case.  On the couple of RARE occasions when there has been an issue, the forums have proved very helpful and I got it solved immediately.</p><p>5. Arch is freakin cool.  It is also different.  Everyone and their mother uses Ubuntu, its nothing special.  Arch has some really nice features like rc.conf (one stop shop file for pretty much all your system config).  Arch also has the best package management I have ever seen in Pacman.</p><p>That’s it, I will stop evangelizing now :-)</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-172274" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="comment-172278"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author">BoBo</span> <span class="comment_date">July 4, 2011, 11:10 pm</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-172278"><p>Arch’s pacman doesn’t have package signing.

Mine is the FX603-064US, Intel i5 480M (2.66GHz), 6GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GT 425M (1024MB) Primary, Intel HD Graphics (Secondary), Intel(R) WiFi Link 1000 B/G/N, Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller.</p><p>This wasn’t a cheap laptop (for me), total cost from Newegg was $749. I can’t afford a SSD, but the Seagate Hybrid is within my budget, a 500GB w/4GB Flash is $99. Fast boot times are reported, the drive gets faster the more it’s used, as it conforms to one’s computing habits.</p><p>As for now, I’m dual booting Ubuntu 10.04 &amp; Linux Mint 11 on my elcheapo HP Pavilion MS214 AIO, AMD powered, and for the most part, it runs good. It’s a rather anemic PC (1.5GHz dual core, 256MB video, 4GB RAM) that shipped with Windows 7 64 bit, but Linux Ubuntu/Mint (32 bit) runs nicely. The reason that I chose 32 bit was that my Kodak printer has a 32 bit driver that’s installed simply by the GDebi Package Manager, while the 64 bit driver is a total PITA to install. Being that it’s a budget PC, I really don’t see the need for a 64 bit Linux OS to be installed on it.</p><p>But as far as it runs, it runs much cooler on both Ubuntu &amp; Mint, my wired &amp; wireless networks both works, and upon installing, there was an AMD/ATI hardware update to address what I presume to be video, which is decent. Not the best, but quite adequate for my limited needs.</p><p>However, I’m interested in a dual boot on the MSI, and with my hardware, I’ll go with 64 bit. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Cat</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-173033" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="comment-173216"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author">ja</span> <span class="comment_date">August 11, 2011, 8:10 am</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-173216"><p>Did you check out <a href="http://www.thinkpenguin.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkpenguin.com/</a> ?

I recall some phoronix benchmarks that had shown that. Low-end video cards had a subtly better performance than the same boards on windows though.

When the proprietary vendor stops supporting their hardware, I know I can install one of the many Linux distros on the hardware and continue to use it for the next 10 years if I want.

Even a netbook with only 2GB will scream if the operating system (OS) uses less than 128MB…think about it!

And the Linux OS will use up less of that RAM, most less than 512MB used by the OS, meaning more memory for the faster running of applications and getting work done.

Also, it can be a struggle in the first years for a startup, both Bill Gates &amp; Steve Jobs found this out. They took some setbacks along the way, but neither lost vision or gave up. Jobs was giving instructions for a new idea less than 36 hours before his death.</p><p>Linux OS’s are great choices for both home &amp; business use. It’s just that money needs to be spent on getting the word out, and control production costs. I’ve visited many of these Linux OEM sites, a few has some decent deals, but many are overpriced for what they are. A $1,000 Linux PC ought to have equal (or better) specs than a Windows one does. At that price, one should get at least a rock solid i5 quad core, 8GB of DDR3 1333 RAM, 1TB 32MB Cache, 7200 RPM HDD, a 1GB DDR3 (minimum) dedicated video card, at least 4 USB 3.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet &amp; a Logitech Wireless Keyboard/Mouse Combo (the last option not needed for notebooks). The monitor, if necessary, the consumer can buy, as they usually do with a Windows PC. Also, a notebook would benefit from a docking station, for the extra ports needed for some components.</p><p>These type of deals can be found all day long at Newegg for Windows PC’s, take away the cost of the OS, put that money towards advertising, a company who really wants to sell Linux computers can grow fast, or at least a steady pace. Taking Apple’s low-spec, high dollar approach won’t get it. Anyone paying out that kind of cash shouldn’t have to be upgrading RAM &amp; HDD as soon as the box is opened, or worse yet, ordering extra from Newegg before it even arrives. If the MB will hold 16GB RAM, cram it in there, prices are great for RAM these days.</p><p>Although some users will want lower cost computers, there’s many who wants performance. I can build the PC that I described above for $650, mabye less, if there’s a rebate/promo on parts.</p><p>So a vendor who buys parts in quantities should be able to build the same for $100 less, mabye more. That extra profit has to be spent on marketing, in the proper places. Like in major PC magazines &amp; other national marketing areas. Until then, many Linux users are going to keep what they’re doing, installing their choice of Linux on a Windows PC or notebook. After all, in most cases, that approach works out quite fine for many users.</p><p>It’s not the Linux users fault that there’s no Linux notebooks or PC’s in the retail marketplace. A major retailer like WalMart would be a prime national retailer for Linux notebooks. Mabye not so with the higher spec ones, but for a vendor who needs to get their foot in the national spotlight, WalMart can put one there. Fast.</p><p>Cat</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-179284" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="comment-180094"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author">Cat Tilley</span> <span class="comment_date">May 4, 2012, 2:34 am</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-180094"><p>No one has responded to my post, which is of prime importance to this thread.

But the popular manufacturers always charge the same price, regardless of whether the hardware ships with Windows or Linux.  Linux is free, so this means you are still paying $100â€“$200 for Windows, even when you dont want it.  Some people call this the Windows tax; others just call it racketeering.  In any case, it does seem like a conspiracy to keep prices high.  This is unfair, and bad for the economy.  Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer really dont need any more of our money.</p><p>Many consumers would buy a new computer with Linux installed if they did not have to pay for Microsoft Windows.  But if the purchase price is the same, they will not bother to learn a new operating system.  The Linux mission of providing free software to the public has been hindered by this unfair hardware pricing policy:  Despite our best efforts, there is still no discounted Linux-powered PC for the poor in many countries.</p><p>Some people would like to buy a new laptop with a virgin hard drive, or no hard drive, and completely customize the machine.  But that is not easy to find either.  If you walk into a typical north american retail electronics store, what you are likely to find is something from HP, Dell, Acer, Samsung, Toshiba, Compaq, Asus or Lenovo… all running Windows.  These machines cannot be purchased without a hard drive or an operating system.  Most of the Linux boxes in India are from the same manufacturers, and do not appear to be truly discounted either.  This lack of free choice is frustrating to many people, and they clearly want more options.  Where can the consumer find alternative brands without Windows, at a genuine discount… especially in America?  Perhaps there should be a web site dedicated to thisâ€“or at least another article.  =)</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-180086" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment even depth-2" id="comment-180095"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author">Cat Tilley</span> <span class="comment_date">May 4, 2012, 2:43 am</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-180095"><p>You bring up a great point.

On my X200 (paid from 300 to 500 dollars) I run Fedora 16 but to tell you the truth, Fedora 14 was the only version that worked out of the box; Fedora 16 had a lot of bugs that made me work really hard to have a solid machine again. I am buying Lenovos for all my relatives and installing Ubuntu, just disable upgrades before giving them to them. I recommend installing Wicd as opose to the network manger from Gnome, it does not give me a single problem when connecting to the routers. Intel WiFI chips are very reliable and the range is pretty long. the tablet part I love, specialy when taking notes at school (xjournal). I would like to know of a place where we can upload images of our machines (recovery disk?), so somebody with the same machine can install the Linux OS already working on that machine (everybody duplicates the same effort to make it work and it is a waste of time).</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-180089" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div></li><li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-180984"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author">Sadun89</span> <span class="comment_date">July 13, 2012, 2:51 pm</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-180984"><p>I have acer aspire 7750-6423 laptop..<br> but it not detect my usb dongle.<br> I have e153 type huawei dongle..</p><p>Anyone knows how to solve this problem???</p></div><div class="comment_footer"> <a class="comment_permalink" href="#comment-180984" title="permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="comment-180987"><div class="comment_head"> <span class="comment_author"><a href="http://www.altlinux.org/" rel="external nofollow" class="url">Michael Shigorin</a></span> <span class="comment_date">July 14, 2012, 6:53 am</span></div><div class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-180987"><p>It’s not relevant to the topic at all but still: I would google up the name of the Linux distribution used adding “huawei e153” to look for a hint.
