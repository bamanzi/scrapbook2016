<h1>Installing Linux on the Asus Vivostick; a review of my early adopter weekend ordeal</h1>
<p>
</p><h3>Arrival of the Asus Vivostick TS10</h3>
I got my Vivostick on Saturday, June 11, 2016 (thanks to Newegg for the
	fast shipping and thanks to FedEx for the 2nd day delivery after I 
	cheaped out and chose the super eggsaver 4-7 business days shipping!)

<p>
I won't bother with pictures; it seems that the Internet is full of 
	Vivostick images but so far has very little actual useful information.

</p><p>
I didn't realize that I had bought the Vivostick right after it started 
	shipping -- but that does explain my inability to find any useful 
	reviews or technical information on the web.

</p><p>
When I started this exercise on Saturday I was completely naive about the 
	issues with installing Linux on a Windows 10, Secure Boot device.  
	I'm now a little wiser and mostly over the frustration -- but
	please forgive me if I still sound a bit bitter.

</p><p>
</p><h3>Running Windows 10 on the Vivostick</h3>
First, I connected the TS10 to my hdmi monitor and booted it.  Initially, I 
	thought that the power button was flakey, but I later realized that 
	it just needed a firm press-and-hold for a second and then it would 
	reliably start.
	I also didn't notice the power light on the power button because 
	the short hdmi cable forced me to connect the device with the button 
	facing away from me.  But, anyway, the light comes on when you 
	(successfully) press the button.

<p>
It booted up Windows 10 and, being no Windows expert (in fact, I'm a complete
	newbie to both Windows 10 and Windows 8) I just followed the 
	instructions to configure the system.  Wifi worked and the fan 
	only ran during the initial boot. I played around with Edge for a 
	bit but did nothing interesting.  Mostly, I just admired the little
	computer which was completely silent when the fan was turned off
	and emitted only a gentle hiss when the fan was on during bootup.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Using the Vivostick on my TV</h2>
Next, I attached the stick to my 50" television and played the first Youtube 
	video that came to mind; The Rolling Stones, Sympathy for the Devil.  
	It played perfectly without so much as a single hiccup.

<p>
</p><h3>World of Warcraft on the Vivostick</h3>
Then, I decided to jump to a real test; I plugged in a USB drive with a 
	vanilla copy of World of Warcraft -- which I had played back in 2006
	on a PowerPC version of the Mac Mini.  I remembered just how 
	terrible the first Mac Mini ran WoW, so that seemed like a fair
	comparison.  After all, this device, while much newer, can't be more 
	than about 5% of the size of the diminutive Mini!

<p>
I found a private server to connect to -- since that's the only way you can
	run WoW version 1 these days.  Needless to say, it was
	a painful experience!  I ran it at 1920x1080 and tweaked video
	settings until things "sorta" worked.  It ranged from 5 to 10 
	frames per second but control using the mouse was so whacked that
	I'm pretty sure it wasn't the integrated graphics adapter bogging down 
	the framerate.  A confirming clue that WoW was in fact CPU-bound is
	that I significantly lowered the resolution in the game and observed 
	*no* increase in framerate.
</p><p>
WoW is fairly demanding on the CPU -- and 
	makes almost all of those demands on a single core.  Probably due
	to the low throughput of the Atom cores, along with that fact
	that WoW mostly uses only one of them, the Vivostick performed 
	about as poorly as the ancient Mac Mini in the WoW test. 
	But that's ok; nobody said the Vivostick was for MMO gaming! 
	The thing I found pretty 
	amazing is that it worked at all and was recognizable as WoW!
	Also, it was cool to see World of Warcraft live on a big screen TV.
	(Later benchmarking confirmed that the individual cores were only
	about 20% as fast as the Ivy Bridge Xeon cores powering my desktop
	PC when running large memory benchmarks -- more on that further
	down the page.)

</p><p>
</p><h2>The obstacles to installing Linux on the Asus TS10</h2>
While that was all great fun, the real point of this device for me is to 
	have a small, quiet, low power AMD64 test host for the MMO game  
	I'm building.  And that game server runs only on Linux.
	Time to start experimenting with Linux installation on the
	tiny computer!

<p>
</p><h3>Getting the Vivostick to boot Linux</h3>
Now, I just happen to have a couple of USB 3.0 thumb drives sitting around
	with full, bootable copies of Linux Mint 17.3.  Leaving out the
	boring details that you really don't want to hear, they simply would 
	not boot!  I looked into the UEFI setup hoping for a simple solution
	like fixing the boot order but quickly resorted to Google searches 
	to try to narrow down the not-so-simple problem.  With Google's help, 
	I gradually 
	became aware that a Windows 10, UEFI secure boot device was not going 
	to be the easiest thing to boot or install Linux on; at least not for 
	someone with little Windows experience and completely oblivious of the 
	apparent central point of UEFI; 'secure' booting to keep the bad
	malware from inserting itself into the Windows boot process.

<p>
And, it turns out that Linux in general is also considered malware to such
	a device -- UNLESS you choose the right distribution.  There are
	several distributions; Ubuntu, Mint, Red Hat, SuSE, among them, that 
	have correct UEFI booting enabled due to their properly registered 
	keys.  Thankfully, my efforts were greatly lessened by the fact that
	I just happened to have a new enough Linux Mint handy.  However,
	my personally installed USB drives weren't set up correctly for an
	EFI boot.  
	
</p><p>
More googling revealed several facts; 
</p><ul>
	<li>There must be an EFI partition on the bootable device
	</li><li>That EFI partition must reside in the GPT partitioning scheme
	</li><li>...Which implied that my USB drive partitioning scheme wasn't 
	allowed
</li></ul>

<p>
Somewhere around this point, I built a bootable install USB stick by using 
	the Linux dd utility to do a bit-by-bit copy of the ISO
	onto a usb drive, thereby overwriting the MBR and partition table --
	making the bits of the USB drive exactly match the install DVD
	that you might use on a different piece of hardware.
	Inspection of that USB drive showed that it did, indeed, have an 
	EFI partition.  It was already built into the Linux Mint 17.3 iso.

</p><p>
Before successfully booting Linux, I also had to change the UEFI setup to:
</p><ul>
	<li>disable 'fast boot', 
	</li><li>enable 'alternative OSes', and 
	</li><li>change the boot order to put the USB drive ahead of Windows.
</li></ul>

	I also tapped F8 as the stick booted to access the boot options
	to ensure that the correct device was selected. I still don't know 
	why this was necessary. 
<p>
	One possible anomaly arose here; when I used the mouse to select the
	USB Linux drive, Windows would boot anyway.  Only when I used
	the keyboard instead of the mouse to select the Linux device and 
	then hit the enter key would it boot Linux!

</p><p>
After all of that (and about 10 attempts at booting from the iso
	usb drive) it worked!  I was finally running Linux Mint on the 
	Vivostick, but was far too rattled at that point to blindly push 
	forward and install directly to the internal SSD.  That decision 
	simplified my weekend considerably, as I was to learn later.

</p><p>
</p><h3>Minor snags with Linux and the Vivostick hardware</h3>
Only two problems arose while running Linux from the installation media;
	the Wifi device was not recognized and, far less important, the tiny 
	cooling fan never stopped running.  Clearly, Windows had a driver 
	to control the fan that was missing from Mint 17.3.  Much worse, the 
	Wifi interface also had no matching driver.  And, as this 
	device has no ethernet jack, I had to get Wifi working.

<p>
I downloaded the latest Mint 18 beta installation media (Mate/AMD64
	flavor just like the 17.3 version) in the hope that a new Wifi
	driver just might be present.  Sadly, 
	that version had no driver for the Wifi adapter either.  
	So, with no reason to install an unfamiliar beta version of 
	Linux Mint 18, I was back to using Mint 17.3.  I also was
	unable to find technical info on the identity of the Wifi chip itself, 
	severely limiting my chances of finding a working driver.  
	(I finally decided to just buy a Linux-tested USB wifi dongle.  
	Another $8 to Newegg and working wifi is on its way to me now.)

</p><p>
</p><h3>Taking precautions: Backing up the Vivostick's internal SSD</h3>
Before I actually did the install, I built a 64GB USB bootable stick with
	an extra 56GB partition formatted as NTFS -- since it was the first
	filesystem utility I tried that didn't refuse to format a partition on 
	my incorrectly partitioned hybrid USB stick.  (Someone familiar
	with GPT partitioning or with more patience that I had at that point 
	could certainly make a valid efi-bootable Linux stick with a proper 
	partition table and use any filesystem they chose -- but I was in no 
	mood to attempt that.)  The 56GB partition was necessary to have a 
	place to put a backup of the internal SSD. And since I couldn't locate
	my USB hub and couldn't be bothered to find a blue-tooth keyboard -- 
	the partition had to be on the boot device itself. (My keyboard/mouse
	used one USB port and the Linux boot drive used the other one.)
	Anyway, it did work.  I was able to boot Linux and back up the internal
	32GB drive (known to Linux as /dev/mmcblk0) onto the USB drive, again
	using the dd utility. That way, when I borked the installation, I could 
	put it back the way it was when it was running Windows 10.

<p>
</p><h3>Choosing the Linux Mint 'Something Else' Install method to reuse the 
	Vivostick Windows partitions</h3>
Anyway, back to the Linux installation onto the internal SSD.
	Specifically, what I found was that the easy way to format the drive 
	for an EFI boot was to reuse the existing GPT partitions.  I used the 
	efi partition for boot, the big partition for Linux's root filesystem,
	and the Microsoft recovery partition for swap.  I only allowed the
	installation script to format the swap and root partitions, being 
	still a little insecure about messing with the efi boot partition.
	This method let me install Linux without having to figure out how to
	configure a valid GPT-partitioned bootable Linux drive.
	
<p>
</p><h3>Linux on the Vivostick!</h3>
I clicked 'Install' and it all worked smoothly from there.  The little 
	Asus machine now boots Linux Mint 17.3 from its 
	internal SSD.  The Wifi still doesn't work, of course, so I can't yet
	do any proper tests with my game server.  When the USB Wifi dongle
	arrives late this week, I'll do some benchmarks of the Vivostick
	running as an MMO server and update this page.
<p>
</p><h3>More performance impressions of the Vivostick</h3>
I did run my old prime number program which finds and spits out the first 
	1,000,000 prime numbers.  It ran in about 25 seconds on the Vivostick.
	For comparision, my Xeon 1220 v2 does it in 7.0 seconds -- or about 
	3.5 times faster.  
<p>
When running 4 copies of the prime number program in parallel, the Vivostick 
	took trivially longer -- about 27 seconds, total.  The Xeon, with its
	much larger and more elaborate  caching system, runs 4 copies in 
	essentially the same amount of time that it runs one copy -- 7.0 seconds.
</p><p>
I ran my large memory benchmark as well. That program was originally
	designed to efficiently mimic a relational database in its usage of
	the CPU and memory bandwidth while proportionately stressing all of 
	the levels of cache.  In that test, the Vivostick ran the 256MB version
	in 35 seconds vs 6.6 seconds for the Xeon.  In this more realistic 
	benchmark the Xeon core was just over five times as fast.  
</p><p>
When running that same benchmark on each of the 4 cores simultaneously, the 
	Vivostick slowed from 35 seconds to 82 seconds, 2.34 times as long. 
	Clearly, memory bandwidth and/or cache contention are not the strong 
	suits of the little Atom quad-core!  The Xeon, by comparison, went from
	6.6 seconds to 10 seconds when each of the 4 cores were loaded with a
	copy of the benchmark, or 1.51 times as long.  Again, dedicated
	L2 caches for each core plus the 8MB L3 cache pay off for the
	Xeon -- which was generally designed for just this kind of load.
</p><p>
	Considering that the Ivy Bridge Xeon chip alone cost 1.5 times as much 
	as the entire Vivostick, and that it, along with its socket and 
	heatsink, are many times larger than the tiny Asus, I'd say that 
	that's not at all a bad showing for the Vivostick!
</p><p>
	</p><h2>Update June 16, 2016:</h2>
	<h3>Wireless is working!</h3>
	The USB WIFI dongle arrived and works perfectly. It is so tiny
	that it almost disappears into the USB socket.   Its full name
	is TP-LINK Nano USB Adapter, Model No. TL-WN725N, and it can be 
	purchased at Newegg.com for about $8 with free shipping as of the
	date of my purchase, June 13th.
<p>
	</p><h3>Audio is still not working</h3>
	The audio problem has proved to be a bit stickier.  I still haven't
	found a working driver that is Vivostick compatible.  There is a
	project to support audio, WIFI, and Bluetooth in the Atom-powered
	Intel Compute Sticks.  Some of those are based on Cherry Trail Atoms
	so it may just be a matter of time until someone puts together a 
	package that works on the Vivostick.  I'll continue following this.
<p>
	</p><h3>Windows 10 recovery worked</h3>
	My Linux dd-based Windows 10 backup was reloaded onto the Vivostick
	and worked perfectly.  The biggest problem is that I forgot to set
	some of the BIOS settings back to their Windows defaults, so 
	Windows thought something was broken.  A quick reboot to change
	the UEFI configuration back to defaults fixed it all and Windows
	is fully functional again.
<p>
	I'll be reinstalling Linux in the next few days and will update
	this page again then.
