  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The environment setup in Termux is similar to that of a modern Linux distribution. However, running on Android implies several important differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Common folders such as /bin, /usr/, /var and /etc does not exist.</li>
  <li>The Android system provides a basic non-standard file system hierarchy, where e.g. /system/bin contains some system binaries.</li>
  <li>The user folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">$HOME</code> is inside the private file area exposed to Termux as an ordinary Android app. Uninstalling Termux will cause this file area to be wiped - so save important files outside this area such as in /sdcard or use a version control system such as git.</li>
  <li>Termux installs its packages in a folder exposed through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$PREFIX</code> environment variable (with e.g. binaries in <code class="highlighter-rouge">$PREFIX/bin</code>, and configuration in <code class="highlighter-rouge">$PREFIX/etc</code>).</li>
  <li>The normal <code class="highlighter-rouge">#!/usr/bin/...</code> she-bangs will not work. Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">termux-fix-shebang</code> script to modify these files before executing.</li>
  <li>Shared libraries are installed in <code class="highlighter-rouge">$PREFIX/lib</code>, which are available from binaries due to Termux setting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable. These may clash with Android system binaries in /system/bin, which may force <code class="highlighter-rouge">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to be cleared before running system binaries.</li>
  <li>Besides the file system being different, Termux is running as a single-user system without root - each Android app is running as its own Linux user, so running commands inside Termux may not interfere with other installed applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Running as non-root implies that ports below 1024 cannot be bound to. Many packages have been configured to have compatible default values - the ftpd, httpd, and sshd servers default to 8021, 8080 and 8022, respectively.</p>
