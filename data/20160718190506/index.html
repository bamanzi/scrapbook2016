<h1>Writing System V init scripts for Red Hat Linux</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All System V init scripts are named /etc/rc.d/init.d/&lt;servicename&gt;
where &lt;servicename&gt; is the name of the service. There must be no
".init" suffix.
</p><h2>Sample Script:</h2>
<pre>#!/bin/bash
#
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/&lt;servicename&gt;
#
# &lt;description of the *service*&gt;
# &lt;any general comments about this init script&gt;
#
# &lt;tags -- see below for tag definitions. *Every line* from the top
# of the file to the end of the tags section must begin with a #
# character. After the tags section, there should be a blank line.
# This keeps normal comments in the rest of the file from being
# mistaken for tags, should they happen to fit the pattern.&gt;

# Source function library.
. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions

&lt;define any local shell functions used by the code that follows&gt;

case "$1" in
	start)
		echo -n "Starting &lt;servicename&gt; services: "
		&lt;start daemons, perhaps with the daemon function&gt;
		touch /var/lock/subsys/&lt;servicename&gt;
	;;
	stop)
		echo -n "Shutting down &lt;servicename&gt; services: "
		&lt;stop daemons, perhaps with the killproc function&gt;
		rm -f /var/lock/subsys/&lt;servicename&gt;
	;;
	status)
		&lt;report the status of the daemons in free-form format,
		perhaps with the status function&gt;
	;;
	restart)
		&lt;restart the daemons, normally with $0 stop; $0 start&gt;
	;;
	reload)
		&lt;cause the service configuration to be reread, either with
		kill -HUP or by restarting the daemons, possibly with
		$0 stop; $0 start&gt;
	;;
	probe)
		&lt;optional. If it exists, then it should determine whether
		or not the service needs to be restarted or reloaded (or
		whatever) in order to activate any changes in the configuration
		scripts. It should print out a list of commands to give to
		$0; see the description under the probe tag below.&gt;
	;;
	*)
		echo "Usage: &lt;servicename&gt; {start|stop|status|reload|restart[|probe]"
		exit 1
	;;
esac</pre>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notes: the restart and reload functions may be (and
commonly are) combined into one test, vis:
</p><ul>
  <li>restart | reload)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are not prohibited from adding other commands; list
all commands which you intend to be used interactively to the usage message.
</p><h2>Functions in /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions</h2>
<h4>daemon [+/-nicelevel] program [arguments] [&amp;]</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starts a daemon, if it is not already running. Does other
useful things like keeping the daemon from dumping core if it terminates
unexpectedly.</p>
<h4>killproc program [signal]</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sends a signal to the program; by default it sends a
SIGTERM, and if the process doesn't die, it sends a SIGKILL a few seconds later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also tries to remove the pidfile, if it finds one.</p>
<h4>pidofproc program</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tries to find the pid of a program; checking likely
pidfiles, using the pidof program, or even using ps. Used mainly from within
other functions in this file, but also available to scripts.</p>
<h4>status program</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prints status information. Assumes that the program name
is the same as the servicename.</p>
<h2>Tags.</h2>
<h4># chkconfig: &lt;startlevellist&gt; &lt;startpriority&gt; &lt;endpriority&gt;</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Required. &lt;startlevellist&gt; is a list of levels in
which the service should be started by default. &lt;startpriority&gt; and &lt;endpriority&gt;
are priority numbers. For example: # chkconfig: 2345 20 80 Read 'man chkconfig'
for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless there is a VERY GOOD, EXPLICIT reason to the
contrary, the &lt;endpriority&gt; should be equal to 100 - &lt;startpriority&gt;</p>
<h4># description: &lt;multi-line description of service&gt;</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Required. Several lines of description, continued with '\'
characters. The initial comment and following whitespace on the following lines
is ignored.</p>
<h4># description[ln]: &lt;multi-line description of service in the language \ #
ln, whatever that is&gt;</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional. Should be the description translated into the
specified language.</p>
<h4># processname:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional, multiple entries allowed. For each process name
started by the script, there should be a processname entry. For example, the
samba service starts two daemons:<br>
# processname: smdb<br>
# processname: nmdb</p>
<h4># config:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional, multiple entries allowed. For each static config
file used by the daemon, use a single entry. For example:<br>
# config: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf<br>
# config: /etc/httpd/conf/srm.conf</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optionally, if the server will automatically reload the
config file if it is changed, you can append the word "autoreload" to
the line:<br>
# config: /etc/foobar.conf autoreload</p>
<h4># pidfile:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional, multiple entries allowed. Use just like the
config entry, except that it points at pidfiles. It is assumed that the pidfiles
are only updated at process creation time, and not later. The first line of this
file should be the ASCII representation of the PID; a terminating newline is
optional. Any lines other than the first line are not examined.</p>
<h4># probe: true</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional, used IN PLACE of processname, config, and
pidfile. If it exists, then a proper reload-if-necessary cycle may be acheived
by running these commands:</p>
<pre>command=$(/etc/rd.d/init.d/SCRIPT probe)
[ -n "$command" ] &amp;&amp; /etc/rc.d/init.d/SCRIPT $command</pre>
where SCRIPT is the name of the service's sysv init script.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scripts that need to do complex processing could, as an
example, return "run /var/tmp/&lt;servicename.probe.$$" and implement
a "run" command which would execute the named script and then remove
it.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the probe command should simply "exit 0"
if nothing needs to be done to bring the service into sync with its
configuration files.<hr>Copyright (c) 1998 Red Hat Software, Inc.
